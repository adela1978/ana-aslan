   <h3> Early life</h3>
  <p>Ana was the youngest of four children, two brothers and two sisters, born to Margarit and Sofia Aslan.</p>
  <p> Ana was said to be a very intellectual child, learning to read and write already by age four. </p>
  <p> At the age of 13, her father died, and her family then moved to Bucharest, Romania. </p>
  <p>It was in Bucharest where she began her studies. She graduated from the Central School of Bucharest in 1915.</p>

  <p> The premature death of her father, whom she was close to, was said to be the reason she wanted to become a physician.</p>
    <p> Although the medical field was not a desirable field for women to enter, Ana Aslan decided that was the path she wanted to pursue and attended the Faculty of Medicine from 1915 to 1922.</p>
    <p> Her mother did not support this decision of becoming a physician because of financial strains, so Ana Aslan went on a hunger strike until her mother accepted her medical career.</p>
    <p> During her time in undergraduate studies, she attended to soldiers as a nurse during the First World War.</p>
