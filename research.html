  <h3>Research</h3>
  <p> After graduating from the Faculty of Medicine in 1922, she began working with Daniel Danielopolu who supervised her doctoral thesis.</p>
  <p> She obtained her M.D. degree in cardiovascular physiology in 1924. Her focus was on physiology and the process of aging.</p>
  <p> While experimenting on the effects that procaine had on arthritis, Aslan discovered other beneficial effects of this drug.</p>
  <p> It was this discovery that led to a three-year study and eventual invention of her drug called Gerovital (H3), which she prescribed for the effects of aging.</p>
  <p> With hesitation from fellow scientists that Gerovital was a "fountain of youth", Aslan kicked off a research study to prove the results.</p>
  <p> Over a period of two years, blood samples were taken from 15,000 people, with some of them receiving Gerovital and some receiving a placebo. </p>
  <p>40% of the people who took Gerovital had less sick-leave days, and mortality rate from the flu epidemic was 13% in placebo patients while only being 2.7% in patients who took the drug.</p>
  <p>In 1976, with a pharmacist named Elena PolovrÄƒgeanu, they invented another drug named Aslavital, which was a similar drug to Gerovital aimed to delay the skin aging process.</p>
